# Gameplay

To start the game, **open the sidebar** on the left hand side. Choose your desired start time and maze size with the sliders. **Press the start button** to spawn your character in the top left. The exit is located on the opposite corner. Your job is to **navigate through the maze using the arrow keys** before your time is out! Good luck!

If at any point you need to pause the game, open the sidebar again. If you would like to get a new maze, click the re-generate button.

# Details
